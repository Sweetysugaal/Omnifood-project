# Omnifood Website

Omnifood is a modern technology-driven food delivery service focused on consumer well-being.  
We help busy people eat healthy every day with personalized, AI-powered meal plans.

## About

We are a technology company first, with a major focus on healthy living.  
Most people are very busy with their jobs, family, and friends, which doesn‚Äôt leave much time for cooking.  
This often leads to poor diets and long-term health consequences.

Omnifood solves this problem using an **AI-centric approach**:

- Users select their dietary preferences (likes and dislikes).

- We partner with restaurants and cooking partners to **prepare and deliver meals** in selected cities.
- Meals are offered in a **monthly subscription**, with options for one or two meals per day.
